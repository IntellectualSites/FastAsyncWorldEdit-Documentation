== Introduction

[NOTE]
This page is currently being revised.

Patterns are used in various commands when changing blocks. e.g. `//set <pattern>` and `//material <pattern>`

== Syntax

=== Blocks

Use the name or id of a block (e.g. `stone`).

=== Inventory

You can use `hand`, or e.g. `slot5` to use blocks from your inventory.

=== Multiple patterns

Use a comma (`,`) to randomly use a block from multiple patterns. For specific ratios you can use `%` e.g. `80%stone,20%planks`

=== Arguments

Pattern arguments should be inside square brackets e.g. `#simplex[10][stone,wood]`

== Pattern list

=== #offset <dx> <dy> <dz> <pattern>

*Desc*: Offset a pattern

=== #mask <mask> <pattern-true> <pattern-false>

*Desc*: Apply a pattern depending on a mask

=== #spread <dx> <dy> <dz> <pattern>

*Desc*: Randomly spread blocks

=== #buffer <pattern>

*Desc*: Only place a block once while a pattern is in use +
Use with a brush when you don't want to apply to the same spot twice

=== #color <color>

*Desc*: Use the block closest to a specific color

=== #clipboard

*Desc*: Use the blocks in your clipboard as the pattern

=== #existing

*Desc*: Use the block that is already there

=== #biome <biome>

*Desc*: Set the biome

=== = <expression>

*Desc*: Expression pattern: http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit/Expression_syntax

=== #relative <pattern>

*Desc*: Offset the pattern to where you click

=== #saturate <r> <g> <b>

*Desc*: Saturate the existing block with a color

=== #darken

*Desc*: Darken the existing block

=== #anglecolor <distance>

*Desc*: A darker block based on the existing terrain angle

=== #desaturate <percent>

*Desc*: Desaturated color of the existing block

=== #averagecolor <r> <g> <b>

*Desc*: Average between the existing block and a color

=== #fullcopy [schem|folder|url=#copy] [rotate=false] [flip=false]

*Desc*: Places your full clipboard at each block

=== #buffer2d <pattern>

*Desc*: Only place a block once in a column while a pattern is in use

=== #angledata

*Desc*: Block data based on the existing terrain angle

=== #lighten [randomize=true] [max-complexity=100]

*Desc*: Lighten the existing block

=== #!x <pattern>

*Desc*: The pattern will not be provided the z axis info. +
Example: #!x[#!z[#~[#l3d[pattern]]]]

=== #surfacespread <distance> <pattern>

*Desc*: Applies to only blocks on a surface. Selects a block from provided pattern with a given ranomized offset [0, +++<distance>+++). e.g. Use `#existing` to randomly offset blocks in the world, or `#copy` to offset blocks in your clipboard+++</distance>+++

=== #solidspread <dx> <dy> <dz> <pattern>

*Desc*: Randomly spread solid blocks

=== #linear2d <pattern> [xscale=1] [zscale=1]

*Desc*: Use the x,z coordinate to pick a block from the list

=== #!y <pattern>

*Desc*: The pattern will not be provided the y axis info

=== #linear3d <pattern> [xscale=1] [yscale=1] [zscale=1]

*Desc*: Use the x,y,z coordinate to pick a block from the list

=== #linear <pattern>

*Desc*: Sequentially set blocks from a list of patterns

=== #!z <pattern>

*Desc*: The pattern will not be provided the z axis info

=== #simplex <scale=10> <pattern>

*Desc*: Use simplex noise to randomize blocks

=== #perlin <scale=10> <pattern>

*Desc*: Use perlin noise to randomize blocks

=== #rmf <scale=10> <pattern>

*Desc*: Use ridged multi-fractal noise to randomize blocks

=== #voronoi <scale=10> <pattern>

*Desc*: Use voronoi noise to randomize blocks

== Introduction

[NOTE]
This page is currently being revised.

== Masks

*To learn about basic masks that WorldEdit offers please click https://worldedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/general/masks/[here].*

A mask is a restriction on an edit for when blocks are placed e.g. only replace blocks below stone. Global masks apply to all edits, brush masks apply to just the current brush.

'''

== Syntax

=== Blocks

Use the name or id of a block (e.g. `stone`).

=== Multiple masks

Use `,`(OR) or `&`(AND) to separate multiple masks. e.g. `grass_block,$desert`

=== Arguments

Mask arguments should be inside square brackets e.g. `#offset[0][5][3]`

== Setting a mask


=== //gmask [masks...]

Perm: `worldedit.global-mask`
Desc: This command applies a mask(s) to all your WorldEdit actions globally. This command masks based on the destination blocks (i.e. the blocks in the world).

=== //gsmask [masks...]

Perm: `worldedit.global-mask`  +
Desc: The global source mask applies to all edits you do and masks based on the source blocks (e.g. the blocks in your clipboard)

=== //mask [masks...]

Perm: `worldedit.brush.options.mask`  +
Desc: Set the brush destination mask

=== //smask [masks...]

Perm: `worldedit.brush.options.mask`  +
Desc: Set the brush source mask

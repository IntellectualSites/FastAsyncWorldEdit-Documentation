== Introduction

* https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13932/[Download the plugin]
* Put "FastAsyncWorldEdit" into your `plugins` folder
* Reboot the server and FAWE will generate all necessary files.

Make sure your server has been launched with https://adoptium.net/[Java 17].

[WARNING]
Do not install WorldEdit! FAWE is a +++<ins>+++direct+++</ins>+++ replacement.

== Logging and Rollback

Enable `use-disk` and `use-database` in the `config.yml` to use the in built FAWE logging/rollback.

It is safe to give normal players access to FAWE rollback. To bypass logging use `//fast`
